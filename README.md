# Digital-payment
1. IntroductionThe Digital Payment App is a comprehensive Android application  developed to simulate core mobile money services such as sending money, buying  airtime or bundles, and paying bills or business tills. The app replicates the real-world  experience of mobile payments, offering users a seamless and secure platform to  manage digital transactions. The project serves as a practical demonstration of  Android development, mobile payment flows, and user authentication using modern  technologies like Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database.Our  primary goal is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can easily perform  financial transactions, manage their profiles, view transaction histories, and adjust their  settings. Each transaction is simulated with the use of dummy data (e.g., test Paybill  and Till numbers), making it suitable for educational and testing purposes.The app  integrates Firebase to handle user authentication, allowing users to sign up and log in  with their email, Google account, or OTP verification. For user convenience, there is  also a password recovery feature that uses OTPs sent via email or phone number for  password resets. Additionally, the app supports SQLite for simulating the contacts  required for sending money, further enhancing the app's functionality without  depending on external APIs.This project highlights several important Android app  development concepts, including secure user authentication, transaction history  management, and UI/UX design principles. The app also showcases how different  mobile money services can be bundled into a cohesive and easy-to-use mobile  platform, simulating real-world financial applications.The Digital Payment App was  developed as part of a student project to demonstrate technical proficiency in  Android development, backend integration with Firebase, and mobile payment system  design. It is designed to provide a practical solution for digital transactions while being  a learning tool for mobile development technologies.
